All the plots are saved in /results folder. While running the files, exit any of the plots by pressing the 'q' key
## Problem 2
### Save data from videos

	 python3 2_data_points.py
This will save data points in a txt file in the /results folder

### Plot Least Square curve fitting graphs

    python3 2_LS_plot_curve.py
This will plot the Least square graphs, press 'q' key to close the window to get to the next plot.
